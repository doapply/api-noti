# Layouts

Novu allows the creation of layouts - a specific HTML design or structure to wrap content of email notifications.
Layouts can be manipulated and assigned to new and existing templates within the Novu platform,
allowing users to create, manage, and assign these layouts to templates, so they can be reused to structure the appearance of notifications sent through the platform.

By default, a Novu layout will be created and assigned as the organization's default layout. At any time, you can choose any of your layouts as the default for your organization.
All new email templates will be assigned the default layout unless assigned a different one through the email editor.

## Manage Layouts

You can find and manage your organization's layouts in `Brand -> Layouts`

   <div align="center">
     <picture>
       <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/img/platform/layouts/dark-manage-layouts.png"/>
       <img src="/img/platform/layouts/light-manage-layouts.png" width="1280" alt="Logo"/>
     </picture>
   </div>

## Create and Edit Layouts

You can create new or edit existing layouts through the layout editor.

- You can create any html code to structure your layout.
- Set a layout as default for your organization. Notice there could only be one default layout at a time.
- Manage layout variables - set default values or required variables.

   <div align="center">
     <picture>
       <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/img/platform/layouts/dark-create-layout.png"/>
       <img src="/img/platform/layouts/light-create-layout.png" width="1280" alt="Logo"/>
     </picture>
   </div>

:::info

Layout content must include `{{{body}}}`, to indicate where the email editor content will be injected inside the layout.

:::

The creation of the layout can also be done through the Novu package.

```typescript
const name: string = 'layout-name';
const description: string =
  'The description of the layout that will help other users to understand the goal it was created'; // Optional.
const content: string = '<EMAIL_LAYOUT>';
const variables: ITemplateVariable[] = []; // Optional. Will handle the placeholder variables inserted in the email layout (content).
const isDefault: boolean = true; // Optional. All layouts are created as non default if not stated otherwise.

const { _id: layoutId } = await novu.layouts.create({
  name,
  description,
  content,
  variables,
  isDefault,
});
```

Likewise, the edition of an existing layout can also be done programatically. When updating none of the properties is mandatory and the API will only update the ones passed.

```typescript
const layoutId: LayoutId = '<LAYOUT_ID>'; // The unique identifier of the layout.

const updatedLayout = await novu.layouts.update(layoutId, {
  name,
  description,
  content,
  variables,
  isDefault,
});
```

And to set a layout as default programmatically it is as easy as to execute:

```typescript
const layoutId: LayoutId = '<LAYOUT_ID>'; // The unique identifier of the layout to be set as default.

await novu.layouts.setDefault(layoutId);
```

When executing this, the existing default layout in the environment will be automatically set as non default and the chosen layout will be set as default. This action is non reversible.

## Assign Layout to template

To assign, choose a layout through the email editor.
You can preview your layout combined with your email content through the `Preview` tab.

   <div align="center">
     <picture>
       <source media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" srcset="/img/platform/layouts/dark-assign-layout.png"/>
       <img src="/img/platform/layouts/light-assign-layout.png" width="680" alt="Logo"/>
     </picture>
   </div>

## Delete a layout

Layouts can also be deleted. The condition to be able to delete them is that they are not a default layout and that haven't been assigned to a notification template.
Programmatically they can be deleted with the package.

```typescript
const layoutId: LayoutId = '<LAYOUT_ID>'; // The unique identifier of the layout to be deleted.

await novu.layouts.delete(layoutId);
```

## Find layouts

There are two ways to programmatically find any layout created in the environment.
One is to retrieve the layout based in its known unique identifier.

```typescript
const layoutId: LayoutId = '<LAYOUT_ID>'; // The unique identifier of the layout to be found.

const layout = await novu.layouts.get(layoutId);
```

The other one is to list the existing layouts of the environment.

```typescript
const layoutId: LayoutId = '<LAYOUT_ID>'; // The unique identifier of the layout to be found.

const page: number = 0; // Pagination value of the page for the results. First page will be page = 0.
const pageSize: number = 100; // Optional. Pagination value of the amount of layouts per page to return.
const sortBy: string = 'createdAt'; // Optional. Property to order the list of the layouts. So far only `createdAt` is supported.
const orderBy: OrderDirectionEnum = -1; // Optional. Direction of the sorting by the property chosen in `sortBy`. Ascendent order is represented by 1 and descendent order is represented by -1.

const layouts = await novu.layouts.list({
  page,
  pageSize,
  sortBy,
  orderBy,
});
```
